To run FastQC, first download FastQC, unzip and change mode of fastqc so you can run it: 
```
wget http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/fastqc_v0.11.3.zip
unzip fastqc_v0.11.3.zip
cd FastQC
chmod 755 fastqc
cd ..
```
Then copy your .fastq files in the FastQC directory, and perform FastQC. Then I copied the .html file into my home directory so I could move the file onto my dekstop and open it. For example: IowaCorn_4539522.3.fastq:
```
cp IowaCorn_4539522.3.fastq /directory/FastQC
cd FastQC
/.fastqc IowaCorn_4539522.3.fastq
cp IowaCorn_4539522.3_fastq.html /your-home-directory
```
