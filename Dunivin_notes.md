* Questions I've been thinking about
  * What are AsRG concentrations across soils? 
  * How does diversity of AsRGs change between soils? Can this be mostly predicted/ explained by community membership?
    * Hyp: AsRG diversity in soil can largely be explained by community membership (evolutionarily old)
      * Lebrun, E. et al. Arsenite Oxidase , an Ancient Bioenergetic Enzyme. Mol. Biol. Evol. 20, 686–693 (2003).
      * Jackson, C. R. & Dugas, S. L. Phylogenetic analysis of bacterial and archaeal arsC gene sequences suggests an ancient, common origin for arsenate reductase. BMC Evol. Biol. 3, 18 (2003).
      * van Lis, R., Nitschke, W., Duval, S. & Schoepp-cothenet, B. Arsenic as bioenergetic substrates. Biochim. Biophys. Acta 1827, 176–188 (2013).
    * Hyp: AsRG abundance (per gene) relates to geography/ metadata (think prochlorococcus paper)
      * Saunders, J. K. & Rocap, G. Genomic potential for arsenic efflux and methylation varies among global Prochlorococcus populations. ISME J. 10, 197–209 (2016).
      * May need more metadata to answer this question
  * What is the distribution of AsRGs in known genomes? Both in proportion of genomes and proportion of different AsRGs
  * In completed genomes, are some AsRGs represented in particular phyla more than others?
    * In particular I am interested in whether thermophiles are more likely to be arsenic resistant (hyp yes)

* JGI preliminary data
