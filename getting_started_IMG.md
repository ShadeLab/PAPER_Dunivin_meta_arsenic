# Getting Started with IMG
### By: Jackson Sorensen

__Downloading Raw Data (IE sequence files) from IMG__

* Log into IMG/M ER in order to view private datasets

* In order to view private datasets click on the link “My Private Datasets” in the left hand column

* To view/search for public data sets select the “Genome Search” link under the Find Genomes tab. 

* Search for datasets of interest based, and select dataset of interest on next page. 

* Click the Download Data link and the Download tab on the next page


__Using Globus__

* Globus can set up transfers directly from JGI to HPCC, without having to use your computer as an in between. Prevents incomplete file transfers. 

Follow instructions on this page. [https://wiki.hpcc.msu.edu/display/hpccdocs/Transferring+data+with+Globus](https://wiki.hpcc.msu.edu/display/hpccdocs/Transferring+data+with+Globus)

* It’s easiest to look up the data files you want to download based on Project Name on Globus.  Note that Project Name is different from the Study Name listed on IMG. Project Name is visible on the page that pops up after clicking the “Download Data” link in IMG. 


__Analysis Carts__

* Analysis carts allow you to subset the massive amounts of data on IMG to only the genomes, functions, and genes you want. Broadly, you add genes, functions, and genomes to carts by searching for those you’re interested under the “Find X” tabs and selecting and clicking the “add to cart” button. Once you have a set of genomes, functions or genes you will repeatedly be interested in, you can download an excel file of the cart which you can upload every time you login instead of re-searching for those items again.

 

__Quick PCoA in IMG__

* If you want to quickly observe how similar your different metagenomes are, you can use the Genome Clustering to make a PCoA. 

* Click on the “Genome Clustering” link under the “Compare Genomes” tab. 

* Select the Genomes you want to compare, normally those you have already chosen that are currently in your genome cart by selecting Genome Cart from the “Domain” drop down box and click “add all”.

* Choose the clustering type you want and the clustering method you want before clicking go to produce the PCoA.
