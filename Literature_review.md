# Review/ notes on studies of AsRG in metagenomic datasets
### Taylor Dunivin

__Goals:__
* Examine the expected distribution of AsRGs in the environment from existing literature
* Tally the different methods (sequencing, assembly, gene count esitmations, etc)
* Tally which genes are tested (some may be infrequent)

### Engel et al., 2013
* Study aims to compare 16S rRNA gene diversity with _aioA_ diversity in microbial mats from arsenic contaminated gyser effluent in Chile. 
* Site is geothermal with temperatures ranging from 50-83C
* Used evolutionary trace analysis to examine functional protein sites in _aioA_ sequences 
* Results may be biased due to using clone library
* Sampled along a shifting gradient with initially high AsIII gradually shifting towards more AsV
* Samples were dominated by chloroflexi and deinococcus-thermus
* "Proteobacteria capable of arsenite oxidation are probably the most fre- quently detected from natural and contaminated settings (Macur et al., 2004; Cai et al., 2009; Hamamura et al., 2009; Heinrich-Salmeron et al., 2011; Sultana et al., 2012)."

### Kurth et al., 2017
* "The bacteria isolated from these stromatolites are, in fact, extremophiles able to resist severe stress conditions, including UV radiation, heavy metals, salinity and, most interestingly, arsenic. Previous"
* Discusses using microbial stromatolie mat communities from extreme environments as models of _early earth organisms_
* Compared data to other microbial mats from MG-RAST!
  * Compared Phylum-level taxanomic differences between study site and other MG-RAST stromatolite sites
  * Compared function level differences between sites as well
  * Moved forward with site most similar to study site
  * Essentially they find more AsRG in study site than in most similar reference
* Site is impacted by volcanic ash
* Difficult finding arsB; much more acr3
* "The thioredoxin-dependent type is much more diverse in Socompa than the glutaredoxin-linked type, probably because the thioredoxin reducing system is more efficient in arsenate decontamination."
  * We see the opposite in Centralia
  * Possible glut is more common in under-contaminated environments?
* Only used full length proteins for the phylogenetic analysis... _good idea_
* acr3 and arsC_thio were most abundant; low arsC_glut and arsB; intermediate arsM, arrA, aioA
* also find mostly alphaproteobacteria aioA
