Tyson, G. W. et al. Community structure and metabolism through reconstruction of microbial genomes from the environment. Nature 428, 37â€“43 (2004).
* Early metagenome characterization
* Contains As in metadata
* Insert plasmid library

### PA_AMD
No available metadata or publications

## Conclusions
* Consider contacting PIs about metadata/ soil to test for As
* Consider geography in analysis?
* Consider perhaps do not consider metadata in analysis (more broad, general conclusions)
